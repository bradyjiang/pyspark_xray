If you develop PySpark applications, you know that PySpark application code are made up of two categories: code that executes on master node and code that executes on worker nodes.  While master node code can be accessed by a debugger, worker node code is like a blackbox and not accessible by debugger.

A lot of posts on web have covered steps of debugging PySpark code that executes on master node, but when it comes to the question of debugging PySpark code that runs on worker nodes, no solution can be found as of July 2020, most people refer to this part of code either as a blackbox or no need to do debugging.

# Overview

pyspark_xray is a diagnostic tool, in the form of Python library, for pyspark developers to debug and troubleshoot PySpark applications locally, specifically it enables local debugging of PySpark RDD transformation functions.

The purpose of developing pyspark_xray is to create a development framework that enables PySpark application developers to **debug and troubleshoot locally and do production runs remotely using the same code base** of a pyspark application.  For the part of debugging Spark application code locally, pyspark_xray specifically provides **capability of locally debugging Spark application code that runs on slave nodes**, the missing of this capability is an unfilled gap for Spark application developers right now.

# Problem

For developers, it's very important to do step-by-step debugging of every part of an application locally in order to diagnose, troubleshoot and solve problems during development.  Given the facts that Spark framework is designed to run on a cluster of computers rather than a single node, and part of Spark code runs on master node and remaining part runs on slave nodes, currently Spark developer community does not have a proper tool to locally run and debug Spark application code that runs on slave nodes.  Spark code that runs on slave nodes usually include lambda functions as parameters for https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#transformations[RDD transformations].

# Solution

https://github.com/bradyjiang/pyspark_xray/tree/master/pyspark_xray[**pyspark_xray**] library enables developers to <<debug-locally, locally debug>> (step into) 100% of Spark application code, not only code that runs on master node, but also code that runs on slave nodes, using PyCharm and other popular IDE such as VSCode.  After integrating your PySpark application with pyspark_xray library, with the use of `CONST_BOOL_LOCAL_MODE` variable from https://github.com/bradyjiang/pyspark_xray/blob/master/pyspark_xray/const.py[const.py] in your Spark code base, you can locally debug and remotely execute your Spark application using the same code base.

check out <<demo-app, demo app>> section for an example use case.

# Demo App

The https://github.com/bradyjiang/pyspark_xray/tree/master/demo_app[**demo_app**] folder contains a simple PySpark application that takes data of 11 loans into a Spark RDD, then calculates interest amount for each loan by passing `calc_mthly_payment` and `calc_interest` lambda functions respectively to 2 types of RDD `mapValues` transformation functions to calculate monthly payment amount and total interest amount for each loan respectively, see input and output below

```

## Code Structure

* const.py, defines a couple of variables shared by multiple modules
* driver.py, main entry point of Spark application, creates SparkConf and SparkSession objects and triggers Spark application
* main.py, the backbone of Spark application, runs on master node, read data into RDD, then perform RDD transformations, then print output
* utils_m.py, utility functions that run on master node, mainly for data ingestion purpose
* utils_s.py, lambda functions that are passed as parameters to RDD transformation functions, run on slave nodes

## Dependencies

* pyspark_xray (this package)
* spark
* pyspark
* java
* PyCharm

## Preparation

* Open command line, kick off `java` command, if you get an error, then download and install **java** (version 1.8.0_221 as of April 2020)
* If you don't have it, download and install **PyCharm** Community edition (version 2020.1 as of April 2020)
* If you don't have it, download and install Anaconda Python 3.7 runtime
* Download and install **spark** latest Pre-built for Apache Hadoop (spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7 as of April 2020, 200+MB size) locally
  ** **Windows**:
    *** if you don't have unzip tool, please download and install 7zip, a free tool to zip/unzip files
    *** extract contents of spark tgz file to c:\spark-x.x.x-bin-hadoopx.x folder
    *** follow the steps in https://medium.com/big-data-engineering/how-to-install-apache-spark-2-x-in-your-pc-e2047246ffc3[this tutorial]
        **** install `winutils.exe` into `c:\spark-x.x.x-bin-hadoopx.x\bin` folder, without this executable, you will run into error when writing engine output
  ** **Mac**:
    *** extract contents of spark tgz file to \Users\[USERNAME]\spark-x.x.x-bin-hadoopx.x folder
* install **pyspark** by `pip install pyspark` or `conda install pyspark`

## Run Configuration

You run Spark application on a cluster from command line by issuing `spark-submit` command which submit a Spark job to the cluster.  But from PyCharm or other IDE on a local laptop or PC, `spark-submit` cannot be used to kick off a Spark job.  Instead, follow these steps to set up a Run Configuration of pyspark_xray's demo_app on PyCharm

* Set Environment Variables:
** set `HADOOP_HOME` value to `C:\spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7`
** set `SPARK_HOME` value to `C:\spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7`
* use Github Desktop or other git tools to clone `pyspark_xray` from Github
* PyCharm > Open pyspark_xray as project
* Open PyCharm > Run > Edit Configurations > Defaults > Python and enter the following values:
  ** **Environment variables** (Windows): `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1;PYSPARK_PYTHON=python;PYTHONPATH=$SPARK_HOME/python;PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS=pyspark-shell;`
* Open PyCharm > Run > Edit Configurations, create a new Python configuration, point the script to the path of `driver.py` of pyspark_xray > demo_app (see screen shot below)

## Debug Locally

In https://github.com/bradyjiang/pyspark_xray/blob/master/demo_app/main.py[main.py], after loan data is ingested into RDD, two types of RDD transformation functions are called one after the other to demonstrate difference of debugging capability between pyspark_xray's RDD transformation wrappers vs native RDD transformation functions.

At first, native RDD `mapValues` transformation function is called with `calc_mthly_interest` as lambda function parameter

```python
rdd_pmt = loan_rdd.mapValues(lambda x: utils_slave.calc_mthly_payment(row=x))
```

Then pyspark_xray's wrapper function of RDD `mapValues` transformation function, i.e. `wrapper_mapvalues` function, is called with `calc_interest` as lambda function parameter

```python
rdd_int = utils_debugger.wrapper_mapvalues(input_rdd=loan_rdd
        , lambda_func=lambda x: utils_slave.calc_interest(row=x)
        , spark_context=self.spark_context
        , debug_flag=const_xray.CONST_BOOL_LOCAL_MODE)
```

Correspondingly, break points are set within  `calc_mthly_payment` and `calc_interest` lambda functions respectively in https://github.com/bradyjiang/pyspark_xray/blob/master/demo_app/utils_s.py[utils_s.py].  **NOTE**: these are break points that were not stoppable before adopting pyspark_xray.

Now start debugging demo_app and the break point set in `calc_mthly_payment` function will be skipped, but break point in `calc_interest` function will be stopped, see below.  The reason is because `calc_interest` lamdba function was passed to pyspark_xray's wrapper function of RDD `mapValues` transformation, while `calc_mthly_payment` function was passed to original RDD `mapValues` transformation.
